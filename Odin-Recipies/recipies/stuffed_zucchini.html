    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here's a delicious way to solve the problem of those too-big zucchinis ballooning in your garden at the end of the summer: zucchini boats baked and stuffed with lamb, feta, pine nuts, tomatoes, and more. It's just like your mother used to make, but with an exotic Mediterranean twist! </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 extra large zucchini, halved lengthwise </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
        <li> 1 sweet onion, chopped  1 tablespoon chopped garlic </li>
        <li> 1 pound ground lamb </li>
        <li> coarse salt to taste </li>
        <li> ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li> 1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce </li>
        <li> 2 tomatoes, chopped </li>
        <li> 3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup pine nuts </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup mint leaves </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup water </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup mint leaves </li>
        <li> 3/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs </li>
        <li> 3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Use a melon baller to separate and remove seeds and pulp separately from the zucchini, carving out each half and leaving about a half-inch shell. Chop zucchini pulp into pieces about 1/4 inch in diameter. Discard seeds.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add ground lamb; continue to cook and stir until lamb is lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir chopped zucchini into the lamb mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer mixture until the zucchini is hot, about 3 minutes. Drain excess grease. Season lamb mixture with coarse salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Remove skillet from heat. Stir tomato sauce, tomatoes, feta cheese, pine nuts, and 1/4 cup mint leaves through the lamb mixture; spoon into the zucchini halves. Put stuffed zucchini halves into a large baking dish. Pour water into the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Mix bread crumbs and mozzarella cheese in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/4 cup mint leaves over the zucchini and top with the bread crumb mixture. Continue baking until the top is crusty and browned, about 10 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>You can use basil in place of the mint. Using mint or basil will send the flavor either in a Middle-Eastern or Italian direction. If you use basil, consider changing the meat to ground beef, the nuts to walnuts, and the cheese to all mozzarella.</p>
